//! A crate for dissecting and sculpting Network packets.
//!
//! Being able to dissect a stream of bytes from wire into a human or machine readable structures
//! can be useful in many applications. `scalpel` is designed for such use cases. The functionality
//! of scalpel is designed for use-cases that are targetted by [gopacket][go-packet] or
//! [Wireshark][ws].
//!
//! [go-packet]: https://github.com/google/gopacket/
//! [ws]: https://wireshark.org
//!
//! The main focus of `scalpel` is to provide API based framework for dissecting packets such that
//! it's possible for anyone to write a dissector for a new protocol. `scalpel` natively supports
//! dissection for a set of widely used protocols out of the box. See [`layers`] for details.
//!
//! A Basic unit in a scalpel is a [`Packet`][`crate::packet::Packet`], a struct representing a
//! dissected Packet from the wire, which is made up of a set of one or more `layers`.
//! See [`Packet`][`crate::packet::Packet`] for details.
