//! A crate for dissecting and sculpting network packets.
//!
//! Being able to dissect a stream of bytes from wire into a human or machine readable structures
//! can be useful in many applications. `scalpel` is designed for such use cases. In other
//! languages such use-cases are served by tools like [gopacket][go-packet] or
//! [Wireshark][ws].
//!
//! [go-packet]: https://github.com/google/gopacket/
//! [ws]: https://wireshark.org
//!
//! Ability to dissect packets and looking at details of each of the protocols carried in the
//! Packet can be quite useful for debugging protocol implementations, network issuess and so on.
//! Also, having such ability in an API friendly way should allow -
//! - Writing dissector for new protocols.
//! - Using the dissection functionality in your own application.
//!
//! Thus, the main focus of `scalpel` is to provide API based framework for dissecting packets such
//! that it's possible for anyone to write a dissector for a new protocol. `scalpel` natively
//! supports dissection for a set of widely used protocols out of the box. See [`layers`] modules
//! for supported protocols.
//!
//! A Basic unit in a scalpel is a [`Packet`][`crate::Packet`] structure that represents a
//! dissected Packet from the wire. This structure carries information about the dissected
//! protocols, each of the protocol that is dissected implements a trait called
//! [`Layer`][`crate::Layer`]. See [`Packet`][`crate::Packet`] for details.
//!
//! ## Opt-in Features
//! - `python-bindings`: Python bindings for the scalpel Rust API. Currently support is to
//!                      generate [`Packet`] structure in Python.
//! - `logging`: Enable logging during decoding the packets. Since, packet dissection is usually
//!              done in the fast, path, use this feature mainly for debugging packet dissections.
//!              an error log is provided for the failing `register_defaults` function when this
//!              feature is enabled.
//! - `wasm`: Build WASM capability in the scalpel. Currently `dissect_packet` API is provided,
//!           dissects the packet and a JSON is generated for the packet.
//!
//! Note: `wasm` and `python-bindings` features cannot be enabled at the same time.
